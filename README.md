# DFA-Simulator
A Python tool for simulating Deterministic Finite Automata (DFAs) by reading transition tables from Excel files. It checks if input strings are accepted, supports verbose output for detailed DFA information, and ensures all transitions are defined. Object-oriented, user-friendly, and ideal for theoretical computer science education.
